# neo.mjs workspace
This repository contains the default output for <a href="https://github.com/neomjs/create-app">npx neo-app</a>.

In case there are any issues with the npx script, feel free to fork this repository instead.
A fork has the advantage that you can do an update in case the default output structure of npx neo-app should
change at some point.

In case you want to get the neo.mjs repository running locally, please take a look at
the <a href="https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/.github/GETTING_STARTED.md">neo.mjs Getting Started Guide</a>.
